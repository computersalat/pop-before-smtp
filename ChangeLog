2002-04-12  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Removed an old comment that got superseded.

2002-04-11  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Added the --logto=FILE option.
	- Removed the day-of-the-week from the stdout timestamp.
	- Don't force the extra expiration check quite so often.

	* pop-before-smtp-conf.pl:
	- Mention the new set_output_log() function, and put the syslog()
	  setup next to it.
	- Added Courier-POP3 to the Courier-IMAP pattern.
	- If the default watch-log path doesn't exist, try to figure out one
	  that does.

	* pop-before-smtp.init:
	- Only intuit command-line options if there is no config file present.
	- Added code for Mandrake's /var/log/mail/info log file.
	- Got rid of hard-coded /usr/bin path to ps (ps is in /bin on many
	  systems).

2002-04-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Moved the config items into a config file and added the
	  --config=FILE option to override its default location.
	- Enabled only one $pat variable by default (UW).
	- Added the ability to use a custom_match() function to enable more
	  complex watch-log matching.
	- Changed the name of the --logfile option to --watchlog (though we
	  still accept --logfile for backward compatibility).
	- Added the --reprocess option (for debug processing of old log data).
	- Changed the optional output-log messages to have a timestamp, be a
	  little more concise, and support being easily overridden.  This
	  makes it trivial to support syslog() output.
	- Log what signal killed us (if logging).
	- Write the "die" message to the output log (if logging).

	* TODO:
	- Mention a couple items that I'd like to do.
	- Got rid of the separate-config discussion (which is now done).

	* pop-before-smtp-config.pl:
	- Moved the various user-selectable $pat values here.
	- Added pattern for Perdition.
	- Include the various overridable parameters that a user might want to
	  tweak.
	- Added an example custom_match() function for vm-pop3d support (since
	  it requires parsing 2 lines to determine success).
	- Added the necessary setup for using syslog() (commented out).

2002-04-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pop-before-smtp:
	- Improved cleanup_nets() to weed-out comments from included files,
	  de-taint the mynetworks include-file data, and to make the code a
	  little simpler.
	- Changed the expiration code to better ensure that expired IPs don't
	  hang around overly long.
	- Updated the URL to the mailing list and the project's home page.
	- Moved the change-log data into this ChangeLog file.
