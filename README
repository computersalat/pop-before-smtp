This is a simple program for watching /var/log/maillog, looking for
successful logins via POP or IMAP, and maintaining a database that
Postfix can use to decide to let users who've recently logged in
have relay privs. I.e. the server can be set to block spammers, and
still allow legit users to relay through it even if they roam.

Everything is in the script, including the documentation and the
text of the init script and Postfix config recommendation.
