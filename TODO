If the $fail_tail{'tail'} option is not -1 (meaning we don't reread the log
file), perhaps we should leave the current IPs in the DB file on startup, and
set them to expire after $grace elapses (timed from db mtime).

Document somewhere how the current flock setup is adequate for our needs
since we're the only one writing the file (and it does properly protect
a reader from getting corrupted data if the reader process is locking
the file before it reads its first buffer-full of data, as I believe is
the case with postfix).

Factor out the $pats as much as possible.

Add automatic configure-n-install tool.

Document DB lib version issue, diagnosis, fixes.

Make postconf mynetworks default to 127.0.0.0/8 if postconf doesn't.

Add cmdline option for dbfile extention (default ".db").

Add cmdline option for the dbfile value (default "ok").

Add cmdline option to goose the smtp daemon to make it reread the db file
(default nothing).
