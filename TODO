Change some comments that presume we're working with postfix to be more
inclusive of other SMTP software.

If the $file_tail{'tail'} option is not -1 (meaning we don't reread the log
file), perhaps we should leave the current IPs in the DB file on startup, and
set them to expire after $grace elapses (timed from db mtime).

Factor out the $pats as much as possible.

Add automatic configure-n-install tool.

Document DB lib version issue, diagnosis, fixes.

Make postconf mynetworks default to 127.0.0.0/8 if postconf doesn't.
