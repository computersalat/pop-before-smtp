Justin <justin@inwa.com.au> contributed a modified version of the
pop-before-smtp daemon, an appropriate init script, and a helper
script to restart Courier's estmp daemon (needed to make it re-read
the pop-before-smtp.db file). He recompiled Courier to use Berkeley
DB, rather than modifying the pop-before-smtp script to use gdbm.
His work is included in this distribution in the courier/
subdirectory. To make it easier to work out how to apply his edits
to pop-before-smtp as the main version evolves, I've included a copy
of the baseline script he worked from as pop-before-smtp.orig in
that subdirectory.
